**I hope if my skills didn't match the Mid-level position,
 I could get the junior position or the intern** 

  
  

-- I created the project in the simplest way possible, making sure the code simple as possible and easy to read and modify.

-- I also tested the project to make sure it mets all the requirements of the task.

There are 6 products that are displayed, each product is in its own card, and this card also contains a button to add the product to the cart, and if the product is in the cart, the button becomes delete, and there is also a button to display the product card in a separate window.

Knowing that any change is made, affects the rest of the elements.

-- The website is also responsive to computer and phone screens

  



  

# Foledrs & Files

  

- Besides the **HTML** file there are two folders.

  

- The first folder contains the **javascript** files,

		First file contains the products,

		Second file contains the logic.

  

- The second folder contains the **CSS** file.
