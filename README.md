# **This is Valinteca**  **Mid-Level Frontend Developer position's task.** 

**-- I created the project in the simplest way possible, making sure  the code  simple as possible and easy to read and modify.
-- I also tested the project to make sure it mets all the requirements of the task.
There are 6 products that are displayed, each product is in its own card, and this card also contains a button to add the product to the cart, and if the product is in the cart, the button becomes delete, and there is also a button to display the product card in a separate window.
Knowing that any change is made, affects the rest of the elements.
-- The website is also responsive to computer and phone screens**
